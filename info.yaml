  top_module:  "cpldcpu_MCPU5plus"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "cpldcpu"      # Your name
  discord:      "Azure#5593"   # Your discord handle - make sure to include the # part as well
  title:        "Zinnia+ (MCPU5+)"      # Project title
  description:  "A minimal 8 bit CPU"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "This is a harvard style accumulator based cpu. Eight bytes of data memory are included on chip. Instructions are fed into the CPU from an external memory."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Execute the shell script 'run.sh primes' in the src folder. This will invoke the testbench with a rom emulator and execute a small program to compute prime numbers."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "External program memory and bus demultiplexer is required."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     "https://github.com/cpldcpu/tt02-mcpu5plus"      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.
